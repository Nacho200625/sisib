# What is a microprocessor?
It is an integrated circuit , an implementation of a chip.
It is an electronic component that acts as the "brain" of a computer system.
It starts when you on the computer and it initialize the operative system.
## Microprocessor functions
The function of the microprocessor is to retrieve, interpret, carry out instructions, and operate
as a system calculator, being able to do arithmetic operations and also operations
logics between sets, such as union (OR) or intersection (AND).

## History
Marcian "Ted" Hoff formulated the architectural proposal in 1969. However, implementation of the microprocessor only began in 1970 when Federico Faggin was hired by Intel, from Fairchild Semiconductor, to lead the project and to design the Intel 4004.
## Characteristics
It may contain one or more central processing units (CPUs) consisting essentially of registers, a control unit, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and a floating point computing unit (FPU) (formerly known as a "mathematical coprocessor"). ).

The microprocessor is usually connected through a specific socket on the computer's motherboard; Normally, for its correct and stable operation, a cooling system is incorporated that consists of a heat sink, made of some material with high thermal conductivity, such as copper or aluminum, and one or more fans that eliminate excess heat absorbed. by the heatsink.The specific socker is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a network. Sockets play a central role in network communication, enabling applications to connect and exchange information over the internet or local networks.Thermal paste is usually placed between the heatsink and the microprocessor capsule to improve heat conductivity.
## Architecture
They are composed of the following parts:


**Encapsulation:** A plastic barrier surrounding the silicon of the microprocessor, preventing deterioration caused by exposure to air and elements (oxidation).

**Mathematical Coprocessor:** A specialized part of the processor dedicated to solving mathematical calculations, representing its "logical" component.
**Registers:** A type of internal processor memory that holds programming instructions (32) necessary for controlling its operation.

**Memory:** The location where the processor retrieves instructions to execute programs and computer data. While not located inside the processor itself, it is essential for its daily functioning.
Microprocessor includes two types of memory: one volatile (equivalent to that of all processors) and another non-volatile (hard drive memory) when you unplug the computer volatile dissapear , non.volatile dissapear.

**Cache Memory:** An ultra-fast type of memory located within the processor, used to execute operations required for its internal functions. Therefore, it is encapsulated within the processor itself and operates at various levels.

**Ports:** Connections between the processor and the external world, functioning analogously to a telephone line.
## Types of microprocessor
Knowing the number of nucleus they can be : 
### Single core
A single core only can do one task at time.
### Dual core
A dual core can do two task at time.
### Quad core
A quad core can do multiple task at time , so it has the best performance.

# Graphic Cards 
 Graphics cards are essential components in modern computers. They are designed primarily for processing graphics, but are
 also widely used for gaming, professional work (video editing or 3D design), 
 and even cryptocurrency mining. They are responsible for rendering images, videos, and 
 animations for display.
 It is important to know that now graphics cards play critical roles in tasks like AI development,
 video editing, and scientific simulations

**Functions of Graphics Cards:**
Rendering Images and Graphics: Graphics rendering is the process by which the GPU converts 
digital data into images that can be displayed on a screen. This includes 2D and 3D graphics.

Parallel Processing: GPUs are particularly good at parallel processing, meaning they can perform
many operations simultaneously.

Offloading Work from the CPU: By handling graphically intensive tasks, GPUs free up the CPU to perform other general-purpose
computing tasks, improving overall system performance.

Video Decoding and Encoding: GPUs also have specialized units for video decoding and encoding, which accelerates the process of compressing and decompressing video files. This is important for real-time video streaming (e.g., on platforms like YouTube or Netflix) 

Ray Tracing: Ray tracing is an advanced rendering technique that realistically simulates how light interacts with objects in a 3D environment, producing effects like accurate shadows, reflections, and refractions.

Real-Time Rendering: Real-time rendering is a key function in applications like video games, simulators, and augmented/virtual reality. In these applications, the GPU must generate graphics instantly to provide an interactive and dynamic experience.

**Charasteristics of Graphics Cards:**
GPU Architecture
The main manufacturers of graphics cards are NVIDIA and AMD, each with its own architecture. Examples include NVIDIA's Turing, Ampere, and Ada Lovelace architectures, or AMD's RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 architectures.
The architecture directly impacts performance, efficiency, and support for technologies like ray tracing and AI-enhanced graphics.

CUDA Cores / Stream Processors
NVIDIA GPUs have CUDA cores, while AMD has stream processors. These cores or processors are responsible for performing the graphical computations.
A higher number of cores or processors typically improves performance in parallelized tasks, such as gaming or rendering graphics.

Base Clock and Boost Clock
The base clock is the minimum speed at which the GPU operates, while the boost clock is the maximum speed it can reach under load.
A higher clock speed usually translates into better performance, but factors like cooling also influence the ability to maintain high speeds.

**Types of Graphic Cards:**

There are two basic groups:
**Integrated** Graphics Cards: Built into CPUs, these share system memory and are suitable for basic tasks like office work, video playback, and light gaming. Examples: Intel Iris Xe, AMD Radeon Vega.

**Dedicated** Graphics Cards: Standalone cards with their own VRAM, designed for gaming, video editing, and 3D work. Examples: NVIDIA GeForce RTX, AMD Radeon RX.

**Main Components**

GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):
The core of the graphic card, responsible for processing graphical data and rendering visuals.

VRAM (Video RAM):
VRAM is dedicated memory used by the GPU to store textures, frame buffers, and other graphical data.
Capacity: Ranges from 4GB in basic cards to 24GB in high-end models. A larger capacity is ideal
for high resolutions (4K or more) and demanding applications.

PCIe Connector: A slot that connects the graphics card to the motherboard.

PCB (Printed Circuit Board):
It is the base where all the electronic components are soldered.
Designed to minimize electrical interference and optimize data flow.

Cooling System: This includes fans, heat sinks, or liquid cooling systems used to dissipate the heat generated by the GPU.

Display Outputs: Ports for connecting to monitors, such as HDMI, DisplayPort...
